# Web Server Chat
**Luke Ramirez**

## What is this program?

This is a simple Python chat program that runs both a server and client
to allow messaging between multiple users over a network connection.

It uses TCP sockets to handle communication between clients.

## How do I use this program?

Run the server and client programs in separate terminals.

Start the server first, then connect one or more clients to it.
Once connected, the clients can send messages to each other
through the server.

## What else could this program do?

This program could be expanded to run on a web server instead of
locally, allowing clients to connect over the internet.
It could also be modified to support a GUI or browser-based interface.
